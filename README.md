## Setup:
Please follow steps mentioned below to setup news blog locally:

- Clone the repository:

  ```$ git clone https://github.com/HackerEarth/news.hackerearth.com```
  
- We use Jekyll to power our news/engineering blog, install Jekyll using the following command:

  ```$ sudo gem install jekyll```
  
- If you are unable to install jekyll, install pygments first

  ```$ sudo gem install pygments.rb```
  
- You may need to install redcarpet also.

  ```$ sudo gem install redcarpet```

- Start the server by executing:

  ```$ jekyll serve # It will start the server on: http://127.0.0.1:4000```

To start the server on different port execute:

  ```$ jekyll serve --port=5001 # It will start the server on: http://127.0.0.1:5001```

Server should be running now so setup is complete.
