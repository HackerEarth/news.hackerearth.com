Username change is live on [HackerEarth profile
settings](http://www.hackerearth.com/users/profile-settings/). Please note that, choosing a username is optional and will give you a distinct Web address for your profile. It will not change the name that appears on your profile, in search or elsewhere on the site.
   In Beginning, HackerEarth used to generate username using user's emailID, now username can be customized by the user *only once* to whatever name they want.

Users will be able to choose username in first come, first-serve basis for your
profile and can edit from [profile settings](http://www.hackerearth.com/users/profile-settings/)

HackerEarth usernames will be available in basic text forms, and you can only choose a single username for your profile and for each of the Pages that you administer. Your username must be at least five characters in length and only include alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9), hyphens("-"), underscore("_") or a period or full stop (".").

Think carefully before choosing a username, once username set cannot be changed again.
