After lots of requests from the developers on HackerEarth and
considering the pros and cons of this, we finally decided to show all the
hidden testcases for a practice programming problem. What matters is that
developers learn from the testcases on what went wrong when their code isn't
correct and hopefully this will help everyone now improve faster over time.

You need to click on 'Input #X' to see input data when you do the submission.
Clicking on smile/frown icon shows the expected testcases. Smile icon appears
when the code runs correctly, frown icon is when code is wrong for that
testcase.

Enjoying solving the [practice problems](http://www.hackerearth.com/problems/)
on HackerEarth. Happy Coding!
