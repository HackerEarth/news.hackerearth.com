In later half of December 2014, we started rolling out the new and better
(and beautiful!) UI everywhere. This included major overhaul in problems
and challenge pages. A website of programmers doesn't have to be old style and
monotonous and we decided to do some major uplifts. The engineering team named it sensual
layout for its visual appeal :)

Here are a few screenshots:

We hope you like the new UI. Happy Coding!
