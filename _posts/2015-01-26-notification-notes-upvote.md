Now you can see who upvoted your note in [HackerEarth
Notes](http://www.hackerearth.com/notes/). A notification is sent to you
immediately and you can see it by clicking on the bell icon in header.
Alternatively, you can view all your notifications
[here](http://www.hackerearth.com/notifications/).

Here is a screenshot of how it looks like:

Hope this will help you keep track of who upvoted your notes and help you
further engage with those developers.

Keep contributing. Happy Coding!
