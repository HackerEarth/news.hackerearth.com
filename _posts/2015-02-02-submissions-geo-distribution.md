Now you can see the reach of a particular contest in terms
of where the users are particpating/submitting codes and also
the most active part of the world as represented by the density
and size of the circles in that region.

Hovering over a circle also gives you the number of submissions
from that region. To view the geo-distribution of users for a
contest, just go to the analytics section of that contest.
