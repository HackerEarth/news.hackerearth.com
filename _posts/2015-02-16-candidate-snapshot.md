**What is candidate snapshot?**
<br>This feature is useful when you want to see the snapshot of the candidate who
is giving the test, thus helping you monitor candidate.

**How does it work?**
<br>Our system takes multiple snapshots of candidate at random intervals(between 5-10 minutes) during the
test. Snapshots taken are available in individual report of respective candidate. Refer to screenshot below:-
