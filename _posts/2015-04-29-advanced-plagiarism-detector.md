**What is HackerEarth Advanced Plagiarism Detector?**  
Plagiarism is a serious issue in any field. Any online technical assesment tool
also faces multiple instances of plagiarism. So to deal with the issue we lauched a
revamped version of our Plagiarism Detection Tool. The HackerEarth Advanced
Plagiarism Detection tool helps the recruiter to find the list of cases of
cheating.

**What does it do?**  
It shows recruiter to find the similarity in the code among the users. The plagiarism
test is done incrementally with each submission.

A sample of the report is shown below

The Plagiarism Report is not an *absolute* decision. The tool does minute level
checks to find similarities and generates a report for the recruiter to review
and take viable decision based on it.
