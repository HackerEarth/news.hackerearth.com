[HackerEarth Email Notifications](https://www.hackerearth.com/users/profile-settings/) allows you to know when someone invites you to participate in a challenge, job updates, when someone follows you or when a comment is posted in your content. Similar to the notifications you see in the top right hand corner at HackerEarth, email notifications let you know what’s happening even when you aren’t logged in.  

You can manage email notifications by selecting the Settings in the upper right hand corner of any page.
