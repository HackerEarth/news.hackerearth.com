Recruiters have been heavily using HackerEarth Recruit. We observed that multiple recruiters of same company use it according to their comfort.
Till now, the first admin from the company had to add and verify rest of the admins from the same company.
If any other admin from same company tried to create an account for himself, we used to ask him to contact the first admin of the company.
This was a little hindrance for recruiters and we have improved it to provide better hasslefree experience for them.

Follow the screens below to see how the new signup flow works:
