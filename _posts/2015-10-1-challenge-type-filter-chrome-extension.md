Using our [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackerearth-extension/aileihjgpakhkhedejpkpamnhpbnjhoj), You can follow all the live and upcoming challenges on your browser itself. As HackerEarth grows everyday, Number of challenges hosted on our site has increased in multitude.

To make navigation easier, We have improved the extension by adding a feature which categorizes all upcoming and live challenges as hiring, programming and college contests.
