Many developers interested to be part of your engineering team visit your careers page. How can you
search for the right candidate from a deluge of applications?

At HackerEarth, We tirelessly work to make recruiting as easy as possible.
We have designed a feature to include programming problems on your careers page. When an prospective employee solves the problem, you will get an
email with the code submission details and participation report is generated instantaneously.

**How to use it?**
You need to embed the iframe code in your careers page. The code is available in the
recruiter portal where you create/edit the programming question.
