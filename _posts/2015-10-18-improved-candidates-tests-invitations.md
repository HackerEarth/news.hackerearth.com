Test invitations to candidates were based on email addresses. So it might happen that single user could be invited on two different emails.
Let's take an example, I have two emails associated with my HackerEarth account.

Say, a recruiter invites me on raviojha2105@gmail.com, an invite will be sent to me.
Now again, if recruiter invites me my secondary email raviojha2105+he@gmail.com, we display a message showing that raviojha2105+he@gmail.com has already been invited.
