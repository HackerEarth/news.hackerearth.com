The recruiters who use greenhouse.io to track the applicants, can now add HackerEarth assessment as an interview stage.

**How to use it?**

* Create your greenhouse API key from personal settings on HackerEarth's dashboard. As per greenhouse structure, one organization can have only one API key.
So , only the first superuser will be able to create this API key.
