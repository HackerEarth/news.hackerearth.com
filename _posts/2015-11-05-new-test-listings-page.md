There’s a lot of information attached to every test. We figured that when recruiters are going through the list of tests, they care about minimal information.
So we decluttered the test listings page and created a minimal interface as shown below. If you’re a recruiter at HackerEarth, access the page through [this](https://www.hackerearth.com/recruiter/all-tests/) link.

As for the important actions that you can perform on a test, such as inviting candidates, extending a candidate’s time limit etc. can be done through Action button on top-right corner.
