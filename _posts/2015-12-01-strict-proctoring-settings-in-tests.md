In the Assessment product, for strict candidate assessment, we have added two new features to test settings.

 - **Logout candidate and mark the test as finished on tab/window switching**

If you enable this settings, then if a user tries to leave the test page in any way, he will be warned that we don't allow this and if he leaves the page again, he will be logged out and his test will be marked finished. Demo video (90 secs) of the flow is attached.

 - **Disabling copying of problem statements**

Candidates will not be able to copy anything from the test interface. Also in case of subjective problems, he wonâ€™t be able to paste copied content in the markdown editor.
