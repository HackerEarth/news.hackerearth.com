Today we have released a feature to save answers for Subjective,
      Frontend & Fileupload questions for recruiters. Recruiters can save the answers while
      adding or updating these type of questions in a test or library. These
      answers are *only* visible to recruiters. They can also view these
      answers in candidates' report while evaluating them.

Please refer to the following images for more clarification.
