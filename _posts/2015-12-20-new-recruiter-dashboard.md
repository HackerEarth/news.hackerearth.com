We have released a new improved and more customizable dashboard for recruiters.

**What is new?**

* Customizable menu panel - At the top of dashboard, you will find a panel consisting of options you have access to. This panel has two parts. First, the always visible part where you can keep the options you use frequently. Only these options will show up in sidebar menu. When you expand the secondary menu, you can keep the options which you don't use much here. So, that your dashboard and list of options is organised and less cluttered.

You can drag and drop options between these two panels.

* Faster lookup - Dashboard now contains live and recently conducted tests / interviews. So that the users can now glance through what is going on right now.

* Better look and feel - Dahboard is cleaner, freeing up space on the screen. Which makes up for better reading.
