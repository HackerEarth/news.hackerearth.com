{% include JB/setup %}

You can now practice problems on HackerEarth in a structured way across topics
and sub topics. Checkout the new [practice page](https://hackerearth.com/topics).

Some features we have built in the current version:

1. Topic wise Leaderboard
2. Topic wise completion(no. of problems fully solved / total no. of problems)
3. Sort problems by attempted/solved/new.
4. Filter problems by difficulty level - Easy, Medium and Hard

We have also cleaned up each problem page keeping in mind readability and
clarity.

We will be adding more features soon. Till then stay tuned.

Happy practising problems on HackerEarth! :)
