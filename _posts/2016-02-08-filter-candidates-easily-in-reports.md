In HackerEarth Assessments, candidate reports is one of the most used sought feature.
After the test, recruiters want to filter and interview candidates as smoothly as possible.
To make the candidate filtering process more seamless, a new functionality has been added in reports.
As a recruiter, you can apply filters according to your own judging criteria and narrow down the number of candidates from thousands to a manageable figure.

Filters can be applied on the basis of any one or multiple attributes at a time:

  - Total score in the test
  - Score in different kinds of problems, say MCQ, Programming etc
  - Total time taken by candidate to finish the test
  - In case of Programming questions, you can also filter by language used by candidates
  - Finish time of candidate, for instance, many a times you just want to filter candidates who finished the test in last 2 days
