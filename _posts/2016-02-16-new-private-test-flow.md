New steps have been introduced in private test flow. The UI has also been revamped. The goal of this change
is to help the candidate understand better the test and proctoring instructions. Currently the flow consists 
of four steps, including the final step i.e. the list of questions.

**step 1**

This step presents general info about the test i.e. description , questions distribution and allowed programming 
languages if there are any programming questions.

**step 2**

This step asks the candidate for any details depending on the depending settings.

**step 3**

This step shows detailed test and proctoring instructions. This step also has a one minute timer to provide
the user with the opportunity to go through all instructions carefully.

**step 4**

This is the final step, where the candidate is presented with the list of questions and his time starts.

A bar on the top is also present listing all steps and indicating what steps have been completed.
