Timed MCQs in tests have been released today. A recruiter can now choose to
limit the amount of time a candidate spends in answering a specific multiple
choice question. Once the time for a question has run out, the candidate will
no longer be able to submit their answer for that specific question.

Here's how it works:

Adding a demo timed multiple choice question:

Candidate won't be able to see the question until he loads the question:

When candidate clicks on the **Load question** button his time starts:
<img src="/images/timed_mcq_3.png" />

After time ends, the candidate won't be able to alter the answer submitted:
