Android application evaluation has never been so easy. HackerEarth Assessment
tool provides an interface to assess applications submitted by candidates **on the browser
with a single click**.

Please refer to the following images for more clarification.

Adding a demo android question:
<img src="/images/android_0.png" />

Candidate submits an android application:
<img src="/images/android_1.png" />

Now in report section a **View APK** button will be visible if candidate has
submitted a valid apk file:
<img src="/images/android_2.png" />

A click on **View APK** button will do the magic of running android
applications on browser:
