The UI of private test interface has been revamped. Now, it looks like this -

<img src="/images/private_test_interface_new.png" />

Some of the more noticeable changes are -

* Expandable and collapsible questions pane

* Layout of question detail pane (right pane)

* Answering and resetting MCQs

* Easier access to instructions in header

We hope that the new UI provides better clarity and candidates find it easier to use.
