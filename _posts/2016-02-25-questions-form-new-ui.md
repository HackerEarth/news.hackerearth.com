In HackerEarth Assessments, new question form were added for better recognition of form options.
More descriptive instructions are provided for form options which were slightly unclear.
For instance, Negative Marks option in the MCQ form below.

In a similar manner, revamped form for other types of questions were launched.
One of the revamped structure is shown below. These are accessible from any test in Assessment.
