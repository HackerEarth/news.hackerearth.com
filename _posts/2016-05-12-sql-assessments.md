A new interface has been added to Hackerearth Assessment tool to assess SQL
skills. As of now we support evaluation for MySQL, PostgreSQL and MSSQL.

Here's how you can do it:

Adding a demo SQL question:
<img src="/images/sql_0.png" />

Candidate attempts the question, executes queries on the test database
provided:
<img src="/images/sql_1.png" />

Candidate submits his queries for evaluation which will run against all the
testcases:
<img src="/images/sql_2.png" />

By visiting candidate report page recruiter can see candidate submissions.
Scores will be automatically assigned during auto evaluation:

<img src="/images/sql_4.png" />
