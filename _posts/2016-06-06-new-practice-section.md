We have conducted a series of experiments which have helped us understand our
users and their behavior better in the Practice section. The new design is the
confluence of the experiments we have conducted which started with the Codemonk
series last year. We believe the new design is the right balance
between easy to read tutorials, practice problems and instant gratification for
users who want to learn or review their computer science concepts. 

Currently we have *Basic Programming*, *Data Structures*, *Algorithms* and *Math* tracks. 
Check new [Practice Section here](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/).

Following changes are introduced in the new practice section:

* For better understanding, now we have tracks at the top which are divided
into topics. Topics are futher categorised into subtopics.

You can also check your last visited subtopic on the right top section of the all
tracks page.

* You can check your progress in a particular track like ranking in the
track and tutorial completeness percentage.

* A tutorial along with a problem is included for each subtopic.

* To hone your skills in that subtopic, you can also solve other
practice problems in that subtopic.

We will keep improving our platform. Stay tuned for more updates.

Happy Coding :)
