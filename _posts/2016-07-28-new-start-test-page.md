The landing page that candidates visit while attempting a test on our assessment tool has been updated. It now looks like this -

<img src="/images/start-test-enter-test.png" />

The following were the objectives behind this change -

* Prioritizing Enter Test CTA in the screen real estate
* Moving additional information and descriptions to second fold.
* Reducing the number of links that lead to other pages (by using modals where possible)
* Updating the terms and conditions in compliance with IT Act, 2000

The interface caters to the following scenarios -

* Test is password protected.

* Test  is yet to start.

<img src="/images/start-test-not-started.png" />

* Test has ended.

<img src="/images/start-test-test-ended.png" />

* Test administrator has disabled access.

<img src="/images/start-test-no-access.png" />

* Administrator does not have enough credits left.

* Candidate has not logged into HackerEarth.

<img src="/images/start-test-login-or-sign-up.png" />

* Candidate's email is not verified.

<img src="/images/start-test-email-unverified.png" />

* Candidate is not invited to the test.

Also, system compatibility and webcam check can be taken on the same page and candidate does not have to move to a new window for it.

We hope that the new UI provides better clarity and candidates find it easier to use.
