HackerEarth has different types of submission activity pages where users can see recent submissions done through _challenges_,  _problems_ or _submissions made by him/her_.

Earlier there was no way to filter submissions based on certain parameters like results, languages or user details. Now users can filter submissions by 

* Result type
* Language
* User's first name
* User's last name, and
* Username

To provide a better experience, we have replaced the infinite scroll with pagination.

These changes have also improved the response time of the submission activity pages.
