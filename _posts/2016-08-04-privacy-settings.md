HackerEarth provides a developer profile to every registered user. This profile is listed in search engine results when a query involves a user's name or username on HackerEarth.

Based on feedback received from users, we have introduced a new feature in settings using which users can choose to disable their public profile. This will also hide the user's profile url from search engines. However, the changes may take some time to get reflected in the search engine results. Users logged-in to HackerEarth will still be able to access the particular profile on the platform.


**To disable public profile:**

* Click on Privacy in the Account Settings
