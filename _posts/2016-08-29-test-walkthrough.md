We have released a new feature in the candidate test interface that helps the candidates to successfully attempt a test, even though they are a first time user. We have launched walkthroughs for each and every type of questions that can be accommodated on our platform.

A short video on test walkthrough should be helpful.

You can try out the feature in our practice test.

In practice test, the walkthroughs auto start on their own. However, in actual tests, in the interest of candidates' time, we don't auto start the walkthrough. Candidates can start the walkthrough by clicking on (?) icon in the top-right corner of the question.

We hope that the new feature provides better clarity to the candidates.
