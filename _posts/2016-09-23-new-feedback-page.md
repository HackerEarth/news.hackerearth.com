The Feedback page that a candidate sees at the end of test has been revamped. It now looks like this -

<img src="/images/feedback_page.png" />

This has been done across all types of events hosted on the private interface. The candidates are now provided to move to the practice section directly from the feedback page to improve their skills.

The entire thing has been designed keeping mind white label solutions.


We hope that this new improvement provides better experience to the candidates.
