We have released option to automatically generate code stubs (i.e. code to read input and print output). Using this functionality, now you don't have to manually write code stubs for each language. You can just configure the input/output using a very helpful configuration form and code stubs will be generated automatically for all the supported languages.

To use this feature, open any programming problem in your test, and click on Auto generate button in the Code Snippets section, highlighted by the image below.

You will find a modal window, which contains the configuration on the left pane and generated code on the right pane.

Currently supported languages are - C, C++, Java, Python2 and Python3. We will keep adding new languages regularly.
